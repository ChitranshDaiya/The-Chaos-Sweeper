        <p>
            You plunk down in the chair, feeling like you just got caught with your hand in the cookie jar. Again. A wave of self-disdain washes over you, making you wish you could just melt away like a popsicle on a hot sidewalk. Or better yet, turn into a cookie, so at least your troubles would be delicious.
        </p>
        <div class="playerDialogue">
            What have I done? I blasted the machine to kingdom come! The scientist told me to keep my grubby paws off it, and what did I do? I went and poked the bear with a stick! While wearing a "kick me" sign.
        </div>
        <div class="blunderDialogue">
            That's right, I'm really disappointed in you. You're about as useful as a chocolate teapot. Or a pair of socks on a snake.
        </div>
        <p>
            Your heart sinks like a stone in a well as you hear Dr. Blunder's voice behind you. You spin around, but the Doc is nowhere to be seen. But you could swear you heard his voice, as clear as day. Or a bell ringing in a quiet library.
        </p>
        <div class="blunderDialogue">
            Up here, you cheese-brained numpty! I'm right in front of your eyes. Are you blind, or just a bit dim? Like a candle in a hurricane.
        </div>
        <p>
            You crane your neck up to see his photo hanging on the wall, looking down at you with a stern expression.

    <div id="p2_3" style="display: none;">
        <p>
            You try to shake off the madness buzzing around your brain like a fly in your ear. Or a bee in your undies.
        </p>
        <div class="thoughtDialogue">
            Great, so now I've even started hallucinating. Maybe I hit my head when I fell into the machine. Or maybe I just inhaled too much of that weird green gas that's always leaking out of the Doc's experiments. I must get home and have a nice lie down. Maybe with a cool compress on my forehead. And a stiff drink. Or three.
        </div>
        <p>
            You stumble out of the lab, locking the door behind you. As you put your foot on the road, the ground beneath you makes a squishy sound, like walking on a giant marshmallow. Or a big fluffy cloud, if clouds were yellow and smelled like feet.
        </p>
        <div class="thoughtDialogue">
            Great, now the floor is made of sponges. This is getting right on my nerves. Okay, now I know what it is. The scientist pranked me good and proper, and he filled that machine with a bunch of silly string. And a whoopee cushion.
        </div>
        <p>
            As you trudge along the road, the sky turns an odd shade of purple for a brief moment, then reverts back to its normal blue. You blink a few times, wondering if you're seeing things. Maybe you should lay off the cheese before bedtime.
        </p>
        <div class="thoughtDialogue">
            Must be that sandwich I had earlier… giving me indigestion and playing tricks on my eyes. Yeah, that’s it. The cheese sandwich of doom.

        <p>
            The buildings around you flicker, as though someone is fiddling with a light switch. One moment, you’re walking past a modern building, the next, it transforms into an old, rundown version of itself. It's like the whole town is playing dress-up.
        </p>
        <div class="thoughtDialogue">
            These new streetlights must be glitching. Seriously, city maintenance needs to get on that… unless the machine really did break the universe.
        </div>
        <p>
            You pass by a parked car, which transforms into a horse-drawn carriage for a split second. The horse snorts and looks at you as if it’s ready for a conversation. Or a race. Maybe it's one of those smart horses you hear about.
        </p>
        <div class="playerDialogue">
            Alright, buddy, stop staring at me. I'm not in the mood for horse small talk right now. I've got enough on my plate, what with the broken machine and the talking pictures and the... oh wait, is that a dragon flying overhead?
        </div>
        <p>
            You trudge along home, your brain getting foggier by the minute. Finally, you stagger through your front door, ready for a nice bath and some snacks. Maybe some of that cheese you were thinking about earlier. Or maybe you'll just stick to toast. Safe, boring toast.
