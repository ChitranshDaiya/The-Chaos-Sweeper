        <p>
            The next morning, things take a sharp turn for the even weirder. You walk out of your house and notice a mix of futuristic technology alongside medieval elements. It's like the set of a very confused movie.
        </p>
        <p>
            The street ahead is a carnival of contradictions: a sleek hovercar hums quietly beside a rickety blacksmith's shop. A knight in full armor holds up the line at a coffee cart, fumbling with a holographic wallet. Behind him, a wizard argues with a vending machine, shaking his staff at the blinking “OUT OF SERVICE” sign.
        </p>
        <div class="thoughtDialogue">
            Definitely some kind of town-wide LARP event going on. They didn’t tell me about it though… typical. I swear, I'm the last to know anything around here.
        </div>
        <p>
            Just as you consider retreating into your house for a bagel and a long nap, a flash of light erupts nearby. You shield your eyes, coughing as a cloud of smoke swirls around you.
        </p>
        <div class="thoughtDialogue">
            Great, now I’m getting flashbanged on my own front lawn. Can’t wait to see what flavor of weird this is.
        </div>
        <p>
            Suddenly, an old man dressed in ancient robes runs up to him, holding a glowing orb. He looks like a reject from a bad fantasy film.
        </p>
        <div class="playerDialogue">
            Yeah, hi. Can I help you? Or are you just here to LARP in my driveway?
        </div>
        <p>
            The old man ignores your sarcasm, stepping closer with an air of urgency. His eyes gleam with the intensity of someone who just realized they forgot to turn off the stove.
        </p>
        <div class="oldManDialogue">
            Ye must help me, young one! The timelines—they are merging! The very fabric of reality is unraveling!
        </div>
        <button onclick="showScreen('#p1_4', '#p2_4')">Continue</button>
    </div>
    <div id="p2_4" style="display: none;">
        <p>
            As the charmingly awkward person you are, you let out a sheepish laugh. Because, really, what's your other option here?
        </p>
        <div class="playerDialogue">
            Yeah, yeah. I know, cool special effects, by the way. So, is this part of the whole event? Do I need to sign up somewhere? Get a costume? Maybe a funny hat?
        </div>
        <p>
            The old man squints at you, confused. Like he's trying to read fine print with his eyes closed.
        </p>
        <div class="oldManDialogue">
            Sign up? Nay, timelines art collapsing, young one! Realities merge, and chaos reigns supreme. Thou art chosen to restore balance ere the worlds are lost!
        </div>
        <div class="playerDialogue">
            Right. And I’m chosen because…?
        </div>
        <div class="oldManDialogue">
            Thou art a janitor, aye? A cleaner of messes? Then heed my words: this task requireth thy very nature! The chaos thou must sweep away!
        </div>
        <div class="playerDialogue">
            Alright, I’ll play along. What do I need to do, Gandalf? Just point me at the bad guys and step aside.
        </div>
        <button onclick="showScreen('#p2_4', '#p3_4')">Continue</button>
    </div>
    <div id="p3_4" style="display: none;">
        <p>
            The old man hands you the glowing orb. It feels warm in your hand, like a cup of tea on a cold day. And you swear you hear a faint hum, like the universe itself is softly snoring.
        </p>
        <div class="oldManDialogue">
            Take this, the Orb of Temporal Harmony! Thou must return this orb to the Altar of Time before the sun sets thrice, cause thereafter all hope shall be lost! Beware, for many trials await thee! Perils beyond thy imagination lurk in the shadows, and foes from all eras seek to claim the orb for themselves!
        </div>
        <div class="playerDialogue">
            (Dryly) Got it. Avoid the bad guys, deliver the orb, save the world. Sounds simple enough. Do I at least get hazard pay for this?
        </div>
        <p>
            The old man tilts his head, looking genuinely confused.
        </p>
        <div class="oldManDialogue">
            Hazard pay? Nay, thou art a hero! A savior of worlds! Thy reward is glory eternal!
        </div>
        <div class="playerDialogue">
            Oh, fantastic. Eternal glory doesn’t exactly pay the rent, though, does it?
        </div>
        <button onclick="showScreen('#p3_4', '#p4_4')">Continue</button>
    </div>
    <div id="p4_4" style="display: none;">
        <p>
            The old man steps back, spreading his arms wide as the air around him begins to shimmer. With a final dramatic flourish, he vanishes in another puff of smoke. The glowing orb hums in your hands, almost as if it’s laughing at you.
        </p>
        <div class="thoughtDialogue">
            Great. So now I’m stuck saving the world with a flashlight that hums. And no map. Perfect.
        </div>
        <p>
            You takes the orb and nonchalantly tosses it into his backpack, where it lands with a soft thud. You hope it won't break. Or explode. Or turn your socks pink.
        </p>
        <div class="thoughtDialogue">
            Well, it's not every day you get to save the world. Or at least, it's not every Tuesday. Let’s just hope I survive long enough to write a Yelp review for this whole mess. Maybe I'll put it on my CV. "Jerry, Janitor and Savior of the Universe."
        </div>
        <p>
            Before you can retreat back into your house to Google “what to do when the universe collapses,” the old man from earlier materializes in front of you in a puff of smoke, startling you so much that you nearly drop your backpack.
        </p>
        <div class="playerDialogue">
            Whoa! A little warning next time, Merlin. I almost had a heart attack.
        </div>
        <p>
            The old man remain silent looking at you intently as if waiting for you to ask something.
        </p>
        <button onclick="showScreen('#p4_4', '#orbQuestion')">Ask about the Orb</button>
        <button onclick="showScreen('#p4_4', '#taskQuestion')">Ask about the task</button>
        <button onclick="showScreen('#p4_4', '#cheesyQuestion')">Ask a cheesy question</button>
    </div>

    <div id="orbQuestion" style="display: none;">
        <div class="playerDialogue">
            Hey, Gandalf, quick question: is this orb dishwasher safe? Because I’ve got to tell you, it’s not fitting in my cleaning schedule.
        </div>
        <div class="oldManDialogue">
            Hush, mortal! That orb is the key to restoring balance to the cosmos! Handle it with reverence, for it holds the power of a thousand suns!
        </div>
        <p>
            You glance at the orb in your bag. It’s glowing faintly and humming like a cat that swallowed a smartphone.
        </p>
        <div class="playerDialogue">
            Right. Thousand suns. Got it. So, where exactly is this ‘Altar of Time’ thingy? And can I get there without walking through dragon territory? Because, call me crazy, but I left my dragon-repellent spray in my other pants.
        </div>
        <button id="orbbtn" onclick="showScreen('#orbbtn', '#p5_4')">Continue</button>
    </div>

    <div id="taskQuestion" style="display: none;">
        <div class="playerDialogue">
            Hey, Gandalf, quick question: Where do I need to go? Do you have any cordinates, some map or maybe a tracker device?
        </div>
        <div class="oldManDialogue">
            Venture forth to the Bridge of Evermore, where thou shalt face thy first trial. Only then shalt thou learn the true power of the orb. But beware, for danger lurks 'round every corner!'
        </div>
        <p>
            He waves his hand again, and the glowing orb in your backpack emits a faint hum. You glance at it, feeling less like a hero and more like a delivery person with a ticking time bomb.
        </p>
        <div class="playerDialogue">
            Yeah, okay. Bridge of Evermore, got it. Let me just punch that into my GPS real quick. Oh, wait, my phone thinks I’m still at the grocery store. Guess I’ll just wing it.
        </div>
        <button id="taskbtn" onclick="showScreen('#taskbtn', '#p5_4')">Continue</button>
    </div>
    <div id="cheesyQuestion" style="display: none;">
        <div class="playerDialogue">
            Hey, Gandalf, quick question: Is there any cheese castle in my way? Where I can earn some magical cheese?
        </div>
        <div class="oldManDialogue">
            Foolish one, dost thou mock the gravity of thine task?! The timelines hath begun to unravel further. Behold!
        </div>
        <p>
            He gestures grandly at the street. You turn to see a castle turret suddenly sprouting from the top of a skyscraper, a laser cannon mounted on it for good measure. Across the street, a group of elves are arguing with an alien over who gets to use the charging station for their respective rides—a unicorn and a flying saucer.
        </p>
        <div class="thoughtDialogue">
            Yup. Definitely not just me. The universe really did go and smash all its LEGO sets together.
        </div>
        <button id="cheesybtn" onclick="showScreen('#cheesybtn', '#p5_4')">Continue</button>
    </div>
    <div id="p5_4" style="display: none;">
        <div class="playerDialogue">
            Well, that was....very helpful? but hey can you atleast......
        </div>
        <div class="oldManDialogue">
            Thou art not given permission to ask any more questions.
        </div>
        <p>
            With another puff of smoke, the old man vanishes, leaving behind the distinct smell of cinnamon and regret.
