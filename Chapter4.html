        <p>
            The next morning, things take a sharp turn for the even weirder. You walk out of your house and notice a mix of futuristic technology alongside medieval elements. It's like the set of a very confused movie.
        </p>
        <p>
            The street ahead is a carnival of contradictions: a sleek hovercar hums quietly beside a rickety blacksmith's shop. A knight in full armor holds up the line at a coffee cart, fumbling with a holographic wallet. Behind him, a wizard argues with a vending machine, shaking his staff at the blinking “OUT OF SERVICE” sign.
        </p>
        <div class="thoughtDialogue">
            Definitely some kind of town-wide LARP event going on. They didn’t tell me about it though… typical. I swear, I'm the last to know anything around here.
        </div>
        <p>
            Just as you consider retreating into your house for a bagel and a long nap, a flash of light erupts nearby. You shield your eyes, coughing as a cloud of smoke swirls around you.
        </p>
        <div class="thoughtDialogue">
            Great, now I’m getting flashbanged on my own front lawn. Can’t wait to see what flavor of weird this is.
        </div>
        <p>
            Suddenly, an old man dressed in ancient robes runs up to him, holding a glowing orb. He looks like a reject from a bad fantasy film.
        </p>
        <div class="playerDialogue">
            Yeah, hi. Can I help you? Or are you just here to LARP in my driveway?
        </div>
        <p>
            The old man ignores your sarcasm, stepping closer with an air of urgency. His eyes gleam with the intensity of someone who just realized they forgot to turn off the stove.
        </p>
        <div class="oldManDialogue">
            Ye must help me, young one! The timelines—they are merging! The very fabric of reality is unraveling!
        </div>
        <button onclick="showScreen('#p1_4', '#p2_4')">Continue</button>
    </div>
    <div id="p2_4" style="display: none;">
        <p>
            As the charmingly awkward person you are, you let out a sheepish laugh. Because, really, what's your other option here?
        </p>
        <div class="playerDialogue">
            Yeah, yeah. I know, cool special effects, by the way. So, is this part of the whole event? Do I need to sign up somewhere? Get a costume? Maybe a funny hat?
        </div>
        <p>
            The old man squints at you, confused. Like he's trying to read fine print with his eyes closed.
        </p>
        <div class="oldManDialogue">
            Sign up? Nay, timelines art collapsing, young one! Realities merge, and chaos reigns supreme. Thou art chosen to restore balance ere the worlds are lost!
        </div>
        <div class="playerDialogue">
            Right. And I’m chosen because…?
        </div>
        <div class="oldManDialogue">
            Thou art a janitor, aye? A cleaner of messes? Then heed my words: this task requireth thy very nature! The chaos thou must sweep away!
        </div>
        <div class="playerDialogue">
            Alright, I’ll play along. What do I need to do, Gandalf? Just point me at the bad guys and step aside.
        </div>
        <button onclick="showScreen('#p2_4', '#p3_4')">Continue</button>
    </div>
    <div id="p3_4" style="display: none;">
        <p>
            The old man hands you the glowing orb. It feels warm in your hand, like a cup of tea on a cold day. And you swear you hear a faint hum, like the universe itself is softly snoring.
        </p>
        <div class="oldManDialogue">
            Take this, the Orb of Temporal Harmony! Thou must return this orb to the Altar of Time before the sun sets thrice, cause thereafter all hope shall be lost!
        </div>
        <div class="playerDialogue">
            Yeah, okay. Cool glowy ball. Where’s this ‘Altar of Time’ thing? GPS coordinates? Address? Maybe a map?
        </div>
        <div class="oldManDialogue">
            (Ignoring you) Beware, for many trials await thee! Perils beyond thy imagination lurk in the shadows, and foes from all eras seek to claim the orb for themselves!
        </div>
        <div class="playerDialogue">
            (Dryly) Got it. Avoid the bad guys, deliver the orb, save the world. Sounds simple enough. Do I at least get hazard pay for this?
        </div>
        <p>
            The old man tilts his head, looking genuinely confused.
        </p>
        <div class="oldManDialogue">
            Hazard pay? Nay, thou art a hero! A savior of worlds! Thy reward is glory eternal!
        </div>
        <div class="playerDialogue">
            Oh, fantastic. Eternal glory doesn’t exactly pay the rent, though, does it?
        </div>
        <button onclick="showScreen('#p3_4', '#p4_4')">Continue</button>
    </div>
    <div id="p4_4" style="display: none;">
        <p>
            The old man steps back, spreading his arms wide as the air around him begins to shimmer.
        </p>
        <div class="oldManDialogue">
            Go forth, chosen one! To the Bridge of Evermore shalt thou travel. Seek the path, and let the orb guide thee!
        </div>
        <p>
            With a final dramatic flourish, he vanishes in another puff of smoke. The glowing orb hums in your hands, almost as if it’s laughing at you.
        </p>
        <div class="thoughtDialogue">
            Great. So now I’m stuck saving the world with a flashlight that hums. And no map. Perfect.
        </div>
        <p>
            You takes the orb and nonchalantly tosses it into his backpack, where it lands with a soft thud. You hope it won't break. Or explode. Or turn your socks pink.
        </p>
        <div class="thoughtDialogue">
            Well, it's not every day you get to save the world. Or at least, it's not every Tuesday. Let’s just hope I survive long enough to write a Yelp review for this whole mess. Maybe I'll put it on my CV. "Jerry, Janitor and Savior of the Universe."
        </div>
        <p>
            You adjust your backpack and set off down the road, bracing yourself for whatever bizarre nonsense lies ahead.
