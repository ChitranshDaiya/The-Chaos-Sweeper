With a shrug, you turn to leave. As you step onto the street, a hoverboard whizzes past, narrowly missing you and sending your bag spinning. A futuristic street sign lights up, flashing the words: "THIS WAY TO CERTAIN DOOM—OR GLORY. YOUR CALL."

Thought: "Well, at least the signage is clear."

You head down the road, dodging a rogue unicorn wearing roller skates and a medieval bard playing techno remixes on a lute. The orb in your bag starts pulsing faster, as if it’s eager to get to the altar—or just impatient with your lack of urgency.

Janitor: “Alright, orb, chill out. We’ll get there. Maybe. Probably. If I don’t accidentally walk into a wormhole first.”

As you round a corner, you come face-to-face with a talking vending machine. Its neon eyes blink at you, and its metallic voice booms:

Vending Machine: “HALT! Traveler! You must answer my riddle to proceed!”

Janitor: “A talking vending machine? Sure. Why not. Lay it on me, Robo-Sphinx.”

Vending Machine: “What hath hands but cannot clap?”

You stare at it for a moment, blinking. Then you sigh.

Janitor: “Look, buddy, I haven’t had my coffee yet. It’s a clock. Can I go now?”

Vending Machine: “CORRECT. But thou must also purchase a snack to unlock the path.”

Janitor: “Seriously? Fine. Give me the cheese puffs.”

The vending machine spits out a bag of snacks with a dramatic whirr and slides aside, revealing a hidden staircase that descends into glowing mist.

Thought: "Because of course the stairway to destiny is behind a snack machine. Why wouldn’t it be?"

You tuck the cheese puffs into your bag and begin your descent, each step echoing as if the universe itself were holding its breath. At the bottom, you emerge into a clearing where the Forest of Perpetual Confusion looms ahead.

Janitor: “Well, here goes nothing. Let’s hope this orb knows where it’s going, because I sure don’t.”

With a deep breath, you step into the forest, the trees twisting and shifting as if alive. The path ahead is uncertain, but one thing is clear: it’s going to be a long, weird day.
