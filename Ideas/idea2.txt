Before you can retreat back into your house to Google “what to do when the universe collapses,” the old man from earlier materializes in front of you in a puff of smoke, startling you so much that you nearly drop your backpack.

Janitor: “Whoa! A little warning next time, Merlin. I almost had a heart attack.”

The old man remain silent looking at you intently as if waiting for you to ask something.

    Janitor: “Hey, Gandalf, quick question: is this orb dishwasher safe? Because I’ve got to tell you, it’s not fitting in my cleaning schedule.”

    Old Man: “Hush, mortal! That orb is the key to restoring balance to the cosmos! Handle it with reverence, for it holds the power of a thousand suns!”

    You glance at the orb in your bag. It’s glowing faintly and humming like a cat that swallowed a smartphone.

    Janitor: “Right. Thousand suns. Got it. So, where exactly is this ‘Altar of Time’ thingy? And can I get there without walking through dragon territory? Because, call me crazy, but I left my dragon-repellent spray in my other pants.”

        Janitor: "Hey, Gandalf, quick question: Where do I need to go? Do you have any cordinates, some map or maybe a tracker device?

        Old Man: “Venture forth to the Bridge of Evermore, where thou shalt face thy first trial. Only then shalt thou learn the true power of the orb. But beware, for danger lurks ‘round every corner!”

        He waves his hand again, and the glowing orb in your backpack emits a faint hum. You glance at it, feeling less like a hero and more like a delivery person with a ticking time bomb.

        Janitor: “Yeah, okay. Bridge of Evermore, got it. Let me just punch that into my GPS real quick. Oh, wait, my phone thinks I’m still at the grocery store. Guess I’ll just wing it.”

            Janitor: "Hey, Gandalf, quick question: 

            Old Man: “Foolish one, dost thou mock the gravity of thine task?! The timelines hath begun to unravel further. Behold!”

            He gestures grandly at the street. You turn to see a castle turret suddenly sprouting from the top of a skyscraper, a laser cannon mounted on it for good measure. Across the street, a group of elves are arguing with an alien over who gets to use the charging station for their respective rides—a unicorn and a flying saucer.

            Thoughts: “Yup. Definitely not just me. The universe really did go and smash all its LEGO sets together.”

            Janitor: “Okay, fine. Timelines are a mess. Got it. But can you atleast tell me where to begin with in the first place?"
