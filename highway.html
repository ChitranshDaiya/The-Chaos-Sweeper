        <p>
            You decide to head toward the Bridge of Evermore. After all, it’s the only place with a name that doesn’t sound like a deathtrap. But walking? Nah, that’s not your style. You need a cab or something equally fancy.
        </p>
        <div class="playerDialogue">
            I have no intention of walking. Must find a cab or something.
        </div>
        <p>
            Just as you finish that thought, a bright yellow cab zooms toward you and you wave it down like you’re auditioning for a role in a movie about desperate taxi hailing. The cab screeches to a halt right in front of you.
        </p>
        <img src="media/cab.png" alt="Zippy the cab" class="centerImg">
        <div class="cabDialogue">
            Yo, man! Need a ride?
        </div>
        <div class="playerDialogue">
            Whoa! I can’t believe I just met Bumblebee in real life!
        </div>
        <div class="cabDialogue">
            Bumblebee? Who’s that? I ain’t no Bumblebee! I’m Zippy, the professional taxi.
        </div>
        <div class="playerDialogue">
            Oh, is that so? Alright, Zippy the professional taxi, can you give me a lift to the Bridge of Evermore?
        </div>
        <button onclick="showScreen('#p1_bE', '#p2_bE')">Continue</button>
    </div>
    <div id="p2_bE" style="display: none;">
        <p>
            Zippy bursts into laughter, the kind that makes you question your life choices.
        </p>
        <div class="cabDialogue">
            Do I look like a charity worker to you, man? I’m a taxi! I charge for my services. And for the Bridge of Evermore? That’ll be 500 bucks, cash.
        </div>
        <div class="playerDialogue">
            C’mon, man. Don’t you think that’s a bit steep for a sweet cab like you?
        </div>
        <p>
            Zippy’s windshield flickers, and a holographic map pops up in front of you. The route is insanely long.
        </p>
        <div class="cabDialogue">
            Look at this, man. It’s at least a 10-hour ride. So I ain’t talking no less than 500 bucks. And don’t try to butter me up—I’m already yellow.
        </div>
        <div class="playerDialogue">
            How about this? 400 bucks cash, and you can pick up someone else too?
        </div>
        <p>
            Zippy ponders for a moment, his digital gears visibly turning.
        </p>
        <div class="cabDialogue">
            Alright, deal. But don’t puke—I charge extra for that. Now hop in.
        </div>
        <button onclick="showScreen('#p2_bE', '#p3_bE')">The ride</button>
    </div>
    <div id="p3_bE" style="display: none;">
        <p>
            You climb into the cab and settle in the backseat. So far, so good. And honestly, things aren’t too weird. Just an Autobot—or maybe a Decepticon—driving you around.
        </p>
        <div class="cabDialogue">
            Hey, Mr. Do you want some entertainment? I got options!

        <button class="entertainment" onclick="document.querySelectorAll('.entertainment').forEach(button => button.style.display = 'none'); changeValue('energy', 10, '+')">Music(+10 Energy)</button>

        <p>
            You’re enjoying the ride when suddenly, Zippy slams on the brakes.
        </p>
        <div class="cabDialogue">
            (To a samurai who just appeared out of nowhere) Hey there, sir! Need a ride?
        </div>
        <p>
            The samurai turns, his sharp eyes glancing over the cab before settling on you.
        </p>
        <img src="media/samurai.png" alt="Samurai" class="centerImg">
        <div class="samuraiDialogue">
            Well, well. Aren’t you Zippy? Heard a lot about you. And who’s this gentleman in the back?
        </div>
        <div class="cabDialogue">
            Oh, him? No clue. Some weirdo, I guess. Anyway, hop in.
        </div>
        <button onclick="showScreen('#p3_bE', '#p4_bE')">Continue</button>
    </div>
    <div id="p4_bE" style="display: none;">
        <p>
            You swear you see a tiny grin flicker across the samurai’s face as he slides into the seat beside you. The cab rolls forward again.
        </p>
        <div class="samuraiDialogue">
            So, traveler. New around here?
        </div>
        <div class="playerDialogue">
            Yep! completely new. But hopefully, I won’t take too long. Maybe three days, tops.
        </div>
        <div class="samuraiDialogue">
            Oh? Must be here on important business. Perhaps I can assist?
        </div>
        <div class="playerDialogue">
            No thanks, brother. I got this… (whispers) maybe.
        </div>
        <p>
            The samurai frowns for a moment. Something about him feels off.
        </p>
        <div class="samuraiDialogue">
            You know, sudden changes can be disorienting.
        </div>
        <div class="playerDialogue">
            Sudden… changes?
        </div>
        <div class="samuraiDialogue">
            Yes. You’ve seen things shifting around here, haven’t you? Strange occurrences? Unexplainable events? Maybe you’d like to talk about it?
        </div>
        <p>
            Okay, now you’re convinced he knows something about the chaos. But instead of pushing the conversation, you decide to keep your lips zipped. You pretend to yawn and drift into sleep.
        </p>
        <button onclick="showScreen('#p4_bE', '#p5_bE')">The voice</button>
    </div>
    <div id="p5_bE" style="display: none;">
        <p>
            Your eyes snap open as you hear the samurai’s panicked voice.
        </p>
        <div class="samuraiDialogue">
            (frantic) I’m begging you! Don’t take the highway! Take the dirt road! Unless you want your body riddled with holes!
        </div>
        <p>
            You groggily look ahead. A massive, swirling orange portal has opened up, and marching through it is… wait, is that an army of chickens with guns?!
        </p>
        <div class="cabDialogue">
            Sir, this detour will take longer. Damn those little animals!
        </div>
        <p>
            The cab veers off-road, narrowly avoiding the poultry militia.
        </p>
        <div class="playerDialogue">
            Alright, I officially have no idea what’s happening anymore.
        </div>
        <p>
            Just as you start feeling safe again, the ground trembles. A massive ostrich stomps onto the road, blocking your path. <br> The samurai instantly reaches for his katana, his eyes locking onto you.
        </p>
        <div class="samuraiDialogue">
            Here, take this! I can’t handle that thing alone!
        </div>
        <p>
            He tosses you a gleaming sword. You grip it tightly. <br> Well. This is happening.
            <br> You step out of the cab. Brave? Stupid? Maybe both. But one thing’s for sure—you’re about to fight a giant bird.
